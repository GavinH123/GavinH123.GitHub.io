In Ics212 we had to make a database that we could access through the command prompt and had to be able to save, rename and pull up information of our choosing by typing in the name of the data. This was gave me many troubles along the way to try to get it to work. The main problems I encountered in C and C++ is trying to do almost anything because of how hard the syntax is to follow. To make anything work you would have to trouble shoot over and over to make sure you get things right. There were even some very simple solutions that I would pass over because of how monotone that unix looks. 

The major things that I took away from that project was how to error check and look for small bugs even with a bunch of different parts of code all working together. It also helped me understand how different parts of code can work together. This was shown to me when creating the user interactive side and getting things from the database itself. In the next part of the project was to then change your code into C++, the languages were very simalar but it gave me a hard time when trying to get things to run exactly the same because certain parts of C++ would not interact as the same as the C code. This taught me insight when trying to conform to the coding style because it was frustrating to know that the code worked but when translating you may not be able to get it to run like you wanted. This project was one of my first projects so it really showed me just how frustrating code can be to work with but in the end of the day you have to keep on plowing through to get the work done.
